# DBM-Help-Reaction-System

These are events for Discord Bot Maker.

When the specified reaction is added to any message after the bot is started,
you will recieve a DM from the bot with an embed messaged, containing the
message specified in the event as well. You can clone these events for different
help messages to be sent to the user who reacts, just make sure you changed the 
emoji/reaction for each and change the message . 

Actions to Change:

Action #3 (Check Variable) - Change "Value to Compare to" to the emoji you want to
use. To find this, find the emoji you want in discord and dont send it. Then go 
infront of the messsage and add a "\" and send the message. This allows you to
copy the emoji. One you have, paste it inside the '' under "Value to Compare to".

Action #4 & 5 (Embed Message) - Chnage the info to what you want your message to
say when sent to users via DM.
